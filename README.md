# WinIsland - A Dynamic Island copy for Windows 10/11
WinIsland (Windows Island) is a Dynamic Island-like recreation for Windows 10/11<br>
Dynamic Island is a feature in iOS in which the camera notch acts as part of the software used for showing notifications and system events.
## Features
Currently, It can only let you control music players and see the thumbnail art.<br>
I am expanding this so you could see other useful information like the Weather or total notifications.
## Issues
- Everything is in one .cs file :3c
